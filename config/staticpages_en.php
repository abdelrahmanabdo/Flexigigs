                      Employers: Create profiles, post projects, search for Freelancers, communicate with
                      Freelancers, negotiate with Freelancers, award projects to Freelancers, manage projects, leave
                      feedback for Freelancers, and pay Freelancers.
                      Service Providers: Create profiles, advertise capabilities, submit quotes, negotiate with
                      Employers, obtain project awards, invoice, obtain feedback from Employers, and receive
                      payment from Employers.
                      1. All freelancers and service providers, registered on this website, work independently and
                      are not employed by nor in direct relationship with FlexiGigs.<br>
                      2. Employer and Service Provider each acknowledges and agrees that the value,
                      reputation, and goodwill of the Website depend on their performance of their covenants
                      and agreements as set forth in their Project Agreement.<br>
                      3. Flexigigs shall not be responsible nor be held accountable for any transaction made
                      outside its platform. As an Employer, you agree to notify FlexiGigs immediately if your
                      Freelancer solicits payment from you outside the Website. As a Freelancer, you agree to

                      operates and is not involved in the hiring, firing, discipline or working conditions of the
                      Freelancer. All rights and obligations for the purchase and sale of services or other
                      deliverables are solely between an Employer and a Freelancer.<br>

                      underlying transaction. FlexiGigs is not responsible in any way for the timeliness or
                      accuracy of the invoices or the timeliness, accuracy, completion or workmanship of any

                      suspension, termination, or any other legal actions, as FlexiGigs in its sole discretion
                      deems necessary to protect the value, reputation, and goodwill of the Website.<br>
                      10. Responsibilities:<br>
                      a. “Employer” is responsible for managing, inspecting, accepting and paying for

                      for the purpose of entering into a bona fide business transaction with other Registered
                      Users.<br>
                      13. Both Employer and Service Provider each agree that they will not use the Website or its
                      services to defraud or mislead any person or entity, including without limitation FlexiGigs
                      or any Register User.<br>
                      14. FlexiGigs will not provide any Freelancer with any materials or tools to complete any
                      Project.<br>
                      15. FlexiGigs acts as a payment provider by creating, hosting, maintaining, and providing the
                      FlexiGigs Billing and Payment Services to you via the Internet. FlexiGigs does not have
                      any control over the services invoiced or paid for with the FlexiGigs Billing and Payment
                      Services.<br>
                      16. FlexiGigs reserves the right to revise these Terms of Service and all linked information,
                      from time to time, at its sole discretion by updating this posting or any linked information.
                      17. FlexiGigs may add, delete or modify some or all of its Services at any time and at its sole
                      discretion; with reasonable notice posted in advance on the Website.
                      18. For more convenience to users, FlexiGigs offers Freelancers different payment methods.
                      Each takes different timeframes for processing.<br>
                      19. It is really imperative for a service provider to safeguard his/her own work to protect
                      his/her intellectual rights. Should he/she fail to do so, FlexiGigs shall not be liable.'],

                        of 7% over and above service cost in handling fees.</p>
